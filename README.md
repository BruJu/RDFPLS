# RDFPLS

Resource Description Framework Programming Language S (the S stands for whatever
you like. I like to think it means Stupid because it is a bad idea) is a
joke programming language using RDF.

## Getting started

- Clone the repository (eh)
- `npm install`
- `node rdfplsinterpreter.js examples\helloworld.ttl`

```
Hello world
Currently only print is supported
```
## TODO

- Basic maths
- Variables
- Branchs
- Loops (and at this point, RDFPLS will be turing complete!)
- Functions
